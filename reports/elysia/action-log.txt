2025-09-09T00:00:00Z Initialized Elysia chart scaffold (Chart.yaml, values.yaml, README.md, preliminary schema)
2025-09-09T00:05:00Z Completed values.schema.json with validation patterns
2025-09-09T00:06:00Z Added 1Password helper script tools/elysia-op-create.sh
2025-09-09T00:15:00Z Ran helm lint (noted schedule regex mismatch and missing dependency)
2025-09-09T00:16:00Z Ran helm template (empty due to dependency not fetched / no templates besides backups)
2025-09-09T00:25:00Z Removed failing backups-cronjob template pending dependency resolution; backups logic remains in values/backups section
2025-09-09T00:32:00Z Re-added backups CronJob template (still lint parse issues with Helm YAML) and relaxed cron schedule regex pattern
2025-09-11T00:00:00Z Fixed duplicate CronJob and templating for PVC claimName in templates/backups-cronjob.yaml; removed duplicate block and converted claimName to safe templated expression.
2025-09-11T00:05:00Z Added Dockerfile at apps/elysia/Dockerfile to build Elysia via `pip install` from GitHub (default ref: main). Created non-root user and exposed port 8080.
