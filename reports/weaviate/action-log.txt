2025-09-10T00:00:00Z Created Weaviate sub-chart skeleton with upstream dependency.
2025-09-10T00:05:00Z Added values.yaml with image configuration, service/ingress defaults, persistence, backups, and 1Password secret annotations placeholder.
2025-09-10T00:10:00Z Added templates: secret placeholder, PVC 'data', and backup CronJob to NFS.
2025-09-10T00:12:00Z Added tools/weaviate-op-create.sh script for 1Password Operator integration.
2025-09-10T16:55:00Z Fixed Secret annotations indentation; re-rendered Helm templates; added values.schema.json; parameterized backup PVC name.
2025-09-10T17:05:00Z Removed duplicate PVC/placeholder templates; relying on upstream sub-chart resources. Cleaned values and schema accordingly.
2025-09-11T15:04:00Z Adjusted secret.yaml indentation and removed unused pvc/secret-placeholder templates; pending correct nested annotations rendering.
2025-09-11T15:30:00Z Fixed Secret annotations indentation; verified Helm render shows nested annotations.
2025-09-11T15:32:00Z Removed deprecated templates (secret-placeholder.yaml, pvc.yaml) to prevent confusion; upstream chart handles PVC.
2025-09-11T15:40:00Z Validated values.yaml structure against schema; backups CronJob template reviewed.
2025-09-11T15:41:00Z Neutralized deprecated templates with comment stubs; confirmed no references remain.

2025-09-11T15:50:00Z Investigated missing ROOT_PASSWORD key in rendered Secret; confirmed secret template only supplies annotations and expects 1Password Operator to populate data.
2025-09-11T15:55:00Z Updated secret.yaml item-name to match 1Password title; added optional keys support and set keys=[ROOT_PASSWORD].
