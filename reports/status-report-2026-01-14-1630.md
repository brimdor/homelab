# Homelab Status Report - 2026-01-14 16:30 CST

## Overview
- **Overall Status**: YELLOW (Ceph HEALTH_WARN)
- **Time**: 2026-01-14 16:30 CST

## Critical Findings
1. **Storage (Ceph)**: HEALTH_WARN
   - 2 OSD(s) experiencing slow operations in BlueStore
   - 1 OSD(s) experiencing stalled read in db device of BlueFS
   - Backfill/Recovery might be in progress or completed? (Status says "2 OSD(s) slow ops", doesn't explicitly mention backfill in the one-liner, but "18 remapped pgs" suggests recovery).

2. **PR Conflicts**:
   - PR #21 (deps update) is not mergeable.

3. **Restarts**:
   - `cilium-c44ng` (5 restarts)
   - `rook-ceph` nodeplugins (various restarts)
   - `gpu-operator` workers (various restarts)
