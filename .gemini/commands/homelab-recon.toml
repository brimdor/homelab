# Homelab Reconnaissance & Maintenance Workflow

## Overview
This workflow performs a comprehensive analysis of the entire Homelab infrastructure, combining reconnaissance across all layers with maintenance verification, security auditing, and update planning. It produces a single unified report covering health status, available updates, security findings, and actionable recommendations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Sync Requirement**: This workflow exists in multiple locations that must stay synchronized:
> - `~/Documents/GitHub/homelab/.agent/workflows/homelab-recon.md` (Primary/Source)
> - `~/.gemini/antigravity/global_workflows/homelab-recon.md` (Antigravity)
> - `~/.config/opencode/command/homelab-recon.md` (OpenCode Global)
> - `.opencode/command/homelab-recon.md` (Workspace)
>
> When updating this file, **always copy changes to all locations**.

> [!CAUTION]
> **FOUNDATIONAL RULES APPLY** - See `_foundational-rules.md`
>
> This workflow follows the **Homelab Foundational Rules**. These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE:
> - **Rule 1**: Work is NOT complete until ALL layers are GREEN (or issues are tracked for action)
> - **Rule 2**: Zero tolerance - all findings must be documented and tracked
> - **Rule 3**: NO pause, NO stop, NO quit until recon is complete
> - **Rule 4**: Continuous validation during analysis
> - **Rule 5**: Report must be comprehensive with all layers analyzed
>
> **Recon is complete when ALL layers are analyzed, ALL findings documented, and issue tracking is updated.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Do NOT add comments to issues.** Comments are reserved for humans only.
> Always **edit the original issue body** to merge new data into the existing content.

---

## Phase 1: Prerequisites & Access

### 1.1 Ensure Local Tools Are Up-to-Date
Before starting, verify all local tools are current and functional.

### 1.2 Access Priority
- **Primary**: Use the local system for all work
- **Controller Fallback**: Only use when local access to Kubernetes cluster is unavailable
  - SSH: `ssh brimdor@10.0.50.120`
  - Homelab files: `~/homelab`

### 1.3 Clone/Update Homelab Repository
```bash
# Clone if not present, or pull latest changes
git clone https://git.eaglepass.io/ops/homelab ~/homelab 2>/dev/null || (cd ~/homelab && git pull)
```

### 1.4 SSH Access to Nodes
Direct SSH to nodes from workstation is **intentionally blocked**. To access nodes:

1. SSH to Controller: `ssh brimdor@10.0.50.120`
2. Navigate to homelab: `cd homelab`
3. Start tools container: `make tools`
4. Wait ~20 seconds for container to be ready
5. SSH to node from container: `ssh root@<nodeIP>`

**Controller**: 10.0.50.120 (user: brimdor, passwordless SSH)
**Nodes**: SSH as root from Controller only

---

## Phase 2: Layered Reconnaissance

### 2.1 Metal Layer (Hardware & OS)

**Validation Steps**:
- Check Controller reachability (ssh brimdor@10.0.50.120)
- Check node reachability via Controller
- Check Resource Usage (CPU, RAM, Disk) via `kubectl top nodes`
- Check System Temperatures (if accessible)
- Check ZFS/RAID health if applicable

| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **GREEN** | Controller reachable. All nodes online. CPU < 50%, RAM < 80%, Disk < 80%. Temps normal. No hardware errors. |
| **YELLOW** | High resource usage (CPU > 80% or RAM > 90%). Disk > 90%. Temps elevated but safe. Minor hardware warnings. |
| **RED** | Controller unreachable. Node offline. Disk full (> 98%). Critical hardware failures. Overheating. |

### 2.2 System Layer (Kubernetes Core)

**Validation Steps**:
- `kubectl get nodes` (All Ready)
- `kubectl get pods -n kube-system` (All Running/Completed)
- Check CNI (Cilium) status
- Check CSI (Rook-Ceph) status and health

| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **GREEN** | All nodes Ready. Core pods healthy. Ceph health HEALTH_OK. Network policies active. |
| **YELLOW** | Single node NotReady (if HA). Non-critical system pods restarting. Ceph HEALTH_WARN (non-critical). |
| **RED** | Multiple nodes down. API Server unreachable. Ceph HEALTH_ERR. CNI failures blocking traffic. |

### 2.3 Platform Layer (Middleware)

**Validation Steps**:
- Check GitOps (ArgoCD) sync status
- Check Ingress (NGINX) functionality
- Check Certificate Management (Cert-Manager)
- Check Identity Provider (Dex/Kanidm)
- Check Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)

| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **GREEN** | ArgoCD Synced & Healthy. Ingress serving traffic. Certs valid. Auth working. Monitoring active. |
| **YELLOW** | ArgoCD OutOfSync (but functional). Expiring certs (< 15 days). Minor monitoring gaps. |
| **RED** | ArgoCD broken. Ingress 404/503 loops. Expired certs. Auth down. |

### 2.4 Apps Layer (User Services)

**Validation Steps**:
- Check App Pods status
- Check Service endpoints (HTTP 200)
- Check Application logs for errors

| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **GREEN** | All apps Running. Endpoints responsive. No critical log errors. |
| **YELLOW** | Non-critical apps down. Slow response times. Minor functional bugs. |
| **RED** | Critical apps (Emby, Gitea, etc.) down. Data corruption signs. Unusable services. |

## Phase 3: Service Verification & Maintenance Analysis

### 3.1 Core Infrastructure Services
- DNS (internal and external)
- Certificate management
- Ingress controllers
- Storage provisioners

### 3.2 ArgoCD Applications
- Check sync status of all applications
- Identify any degraded or out-of-sync apps
- Review recent deployment history

### 3.3 Security Audit
- Check for expired certificates
- Review secret rotation status
- Validate network policies
- Check for security advisories on running images

### 3.4 Backup Verification
- Verify backup jobs are running
- Check backup storage status
- Validate recent backup integrity

### 3.5 Update Discovery
For each component, check:
- Container image updates
- Helm chart updates
- Operator/CRD updates
- Base system updates

### 3.6 Gitea Issues & PRs Analysis

Analyze the state of open Issues and Pull Requests in the primary repository that require action. **Exclude issues labeled `maintenance`** as those are the centralized tracking issues.

#### 3.6.1 Fetch Actionable Issues
Query for open issues that are NOT labeled `maintenance`:

```bash
source ~/.config/gitea/.env

# Get all open issues
ALL_ISSUES=$(curl -s "https://git.eaglepass.io/api/v1/repos/ops/homelab/issues?state=open" \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITEA_TOKEN")

# Filter out maintenance-labeled issues (maintenance label ID = 10)
echo "$ALL_ISSUES" | jq '[.[] | select(.labels | map(.id) | contains([10]) | not)]'
```

Or use MCP tools:
- Use `gitea_list_repo_issues` with `state: open`
- Filter results to exclude items where labels contain `maintenance`

#### 3.6.2 Fetch Open Pull Requests
Query for open PRs that may need action:

```bash
source ~/.config/gitea/.env

curl -s "https://git.eaglepass.io/api/v1/repos/ops/homelab/pulls?state=open" \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITEA_TOKEN" | jq '.[] | {number, title, user: .user.login, created: .created_at, mergeable}'
```

Or use MCP tools:
- Use `gitea_list_repo_pull_requests` with `state: open`

**Identify PR Source**:
- **Renovate PRs**: Author is `renovate[bot]`, `gitea_admin`, or title starts with `chore(deps):`
- **User PRs**: All other PRs (manual changes, feature PRs, fixes)

#### 3.6.3 Priority Matrix

All action items in the maintenance issue MUST follow this priority system:

| Priority | Criteria | Examples | Processing Order |
|:--------:|----------|----------|:----------------:|
| **P0 (Critical)** | Breaks functionality, security risk, data loss | RED status items, CVEs, failing services | IMMEDIATE |
| **P1 (High)** | Degraded performance, YELLOW warnings | High resource usage, expiring certs | Same day |
| **P2 (Medium)** | Pending updates, non-critical features | Major version updates, feature requests | Within 3 days |
| **P3 (Low)** | Minor improvements, non-major deps | Patch updates, documentation | When convenient |

---

## Phase 4: Report Generation

### 4.1 Report File Location
**Reports must always be saved to the `reports/` folder** in the homelab repository.

#### File Naming Convention
```
reports/status-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

If multiple reports are generated on the same day, append a sequence number:
```
reports/status-report-YYYY-MM-DD-2.md
```

---

## Phase 5: Gitea Issue Integration

After generating the report, **update or create a maintenance issue** in Gitea to track findings.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Single Source of Truth**: The maintenance issue aggregates ALL actionable items from:
> - Recon findings (status issues, security concerns, updates)
> - Open PRs (Renovate and User)
> - Open non-maintenance Issues requiring action
>
> Each item must have an assigned **priority (P0-P3)** and health validation after completion.

### 5.1 Issue Management Steps

1. **Search for existing open maintenance issue**:
   - Look for open issues with title containing `[Maintenance Report]`, `[Recon Report]`, or `[Status Report]`
   - Use MCP tools (preferred) or Gitea API to search

2. **If an existing maintenance issue is found**:
   - **Edit the original issue body** (do NOT add comments)
   - Merge the new data into the existing issue content
   - Update relevant sections with latest findings
   - Update the "Last updated" timestamp at the bottom
   - Preserve any existing content that is still relevant (action items, schedules, etc.)

3. **If no existing issue exists**:
   - Create a new issue with title: `[Maintenance Report] YYYY-MM-DD - Homelab Status`
   - Include the full report in the issue body

4. **Labels and Assignees**:
   - **Always add the `maintenance` label** (ID: 10) to issues that require action
   - **Always assign `gitea_admin`** to issues with the maintenance label
   - Use status labels based on findings:
     - `status:green` - All systems healthy
     - `status:yellow` - Warnings present
     - `status:red` - Critical issues

### 5.2 Merging Data into Existing Issues

When updating an existing issue, follow these guidelines:

1. **Preserve existing structure** - Keep the overall format of the existing issue
2. **Update status tables** - Replace old status data with current findings
3. **Keep action items** - Preserve checkboxes and scheduled items from humans
4. **Add new action items** - Integrate newly discovered items into priority sections
5. **Update timestamps** - Change "Last updated" to current date/time
6. **Reference report file** - Add link to `reports/status-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
7. **Update Change Log** - Record any changes made since last update

---

## Phase 6: Cleanup & Summary

1. Close any temporary connections
2. Summarize findings to the user
3. Provide link to created/updated issue (if applicable)
4. Provide link to saved report file

---

## MCP Tool Integration (Primary Method)

Use the available **Gitea** and **GitHub** MCP tools for all repository interactions. These are safer, more robust, and preferred over direct API calls.

### Priority Order
1. **Gitea MCP**: Use for all operations on the primary repository (`ops/homelab`).
2. **GitHub MCP**: Use as a fallback for GitHub-hosted mirrors or if Gitea MCP is unavailable.
3. **API Fallback**: Use raw `curl` commands **ONLY** if MCP tools are non-functional.

### Common MCP Operations
- **List Issues**: Use `list_issues` (Gitea) or `mcp_list_issues` (GitHub).
- **Create Issue**: Use `create_issue` (Gitea) or `mcp_create_issue` (GitHub).
- **Edit Issue**: Use `edit_issue` (Gitea) to update issue body.
- **List PRs**: Use `list_pull_requests` (Gitea) or `mcp_list_pull_requests` (GitHub).
- **Get Repo Info**: Use `get_repository` (Gitea) or `mcp_search_repositories` (GitHub).

---

## Gitea API Fallback (Emergency Only)

> [!WARNING]
> Only use the following API commands if the MCP tools above are failing or unavailable.

### Token Location
```bash
# Token files are stored at:
~/.config/gitea/.env        # For bash/zsh
~/.config/gitea/gitea.fish  # For fish shell

# Load token in fish shell:
source ~/.config/gitea/gitea.fish

# Load token in bash/zsh:
source ~/.config/gitea/.env

# Environment variables available after sourcing:
# GITEA_TOKEN - API access token
# GITEA_URL   - Base URL (https://git.eaglepass.io)
```
